# Adventure Tours React UI

Minimal React components for an “Adventure Tours” landing page: `Header`, `About`, `Feature`, and `Tours`.  
Plain JavaScript (no TypeScript), prop-driven, and designed to be easily reusable or adapted into a design system.

## Features

- Reusable components with default content:
  - `Header`
  - `About`
  - `Feature`
  - `Tours` (with `TourCard`)
- Accessibility-minded attributes (aria-labels, alt text).
- Lazy image loading.
- Prop validation using `prop-types`.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (recommended: >= 18.x)
- npm or yarn
- A bundler/setup (e.g., Create React App, Vite, Next.js, or custom Webpack) — this README assumes a basic Create React App style project.

## 🎨 Credits

The SCSS/CSS styling used in this project is adapted from Jonas Schmedtmann’s course/tutorial.  
All design credit for the original styles belongs to them.  
I have extended the original design to work within a modular React component architecture.
